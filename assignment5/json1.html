<!-- Problem 1: 

Part 1:  Create a JSON
In json1.html, create a JSON to represent a song list.  
Each song should include the title, the artist, the 
year the song was released and one or more music genres 
(genre could be country, rock, pop, metal, ska, etc).  
The genres should be stored as an array within the JSON.

Include at least 10 songs. The data must be real.  
You must have songs from at least 3 genres and at least 3 artists.  
At least one song must have more than one genre.  

Place the JSON object at the top of the file - it should 
be assigned to a variable.

Convert the json object to a string and display the 
resulting text string. -->
