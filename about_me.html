  <h1>Mallika Rangan</h1>
  Two years ago, I went camping with my best friends, Reuben and Anastacia, near Acadia National Park. All three of us are city slickers, so we struggled to get a fire going - but we eventually figured it out. We were all quite underprepared for the cold, and we had to layer tons of clothes to keep warm.

I am obsessed with their medium iced lattes, and I can't go a day without one.

    I love apple pie, and my favorite way to have it is with a big scoop of butterscotch ice cream.</p>
