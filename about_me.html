  <h1>Mallika Rangan</h1>
  Two years ago, I went camping with my best friends, Reuben and Anastacia, near Acadia National Park. All three of us are city slickers, so we struggled to get a fire going - but we eventually figured it out. We were all quite underprepared for the cold, and we had to layer tons of clothes to keep warm.

My favorite restaurant is Dunkin Donuts. I am obsessed with their medium iced lattes, and I can't go a day without one.

    I love apple pie, and my favorite way to have it is with a big scoop of butterscotch ice cream.</p>
