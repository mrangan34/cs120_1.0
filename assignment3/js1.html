<!-- Problem 1:  Ask the user for their first name.  
Now ask the user for their last name.  
(You will need to use prompt() twice). 
Display the response in a popup (alert) as:  
"Your name is <name>" - filling in their full name.  -->

<!-- Now ask the user for the number of children they have. 
Display the number of children on the page as a 
grammatically correct sentence 
( “You have no children”, “You have 1 child” or 
“You have 2 children”, etc). Note - this should 
be on the page (not in a popup) -->
